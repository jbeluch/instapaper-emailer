Instapaper Emailer

This script will email you with any new items in your instapaper account
in the unread queue.  Each time you run the script, it will only email
any items that are new from the last time it was run.

I wrote this script because I wanted a way to read my instapaper items
offline.  I run it via cron, and every morning I have my new unread
articles on my phone to read while I don't have service.

Currently it is setup to use the gmail smtp server.  Simply add your
gmail credentials to the script and attempt to run it.

** Beware the first time you run the script, it will email you
everything in your unread queue.  Consider commenting out the call to
sendmail() the first time you run the script.  This will populate the
pickle file which keeps track of items in the unread queue that have
alread been emailed.
